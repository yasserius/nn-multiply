# INTRO

Each folder (run1 to run6) contains folders that represent different runs and
their corresponding `simulation.json`. The json files inside each of these sub-
directories contains a simply formatted values of the hyperparametric config
and values for R^2, residual and loss values.

# DIRECTORIES

run1/ contains some initial runs that were not used in the final plots

run2/ and run3/ contain the results for the single layer FCN runs.

run4/ and run5/ contain the results for the double layered FCN runs.

run6/ contains the runs used for creating the plot for the residual of the best
performing model.
